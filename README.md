We provided numbers of packages for number of application types:

* Fusion Proton focusing on web/api development on server side;
* Fusion Photon enhanced the way we work with websocket server;
* Fusion Neutron was designed to work with serverless and/or microservice architectures.

Before you start, we recommend you first check our design concepts for better understanding this framework.
